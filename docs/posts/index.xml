&lt;p>Over the past month or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making fairly extensive use of the free version of &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT&lt;/a> as a personal assistant. It&amp;rsquo;s generally been a very positive experience, with just a few pitfalls. So I wanted to talk about my overall experience, how I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it to be more effective, and how I get around the mistakes it occassionally makes. (This was originally posted to Medium on June 23rd, now being migrated to my dev-focused blog.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring Winnipeg Parks - Dev Blog for a Photography and Community Website</title><link>https://ryantherileyman.github.io/explorewpgparks-devblog/posts/2025/07/exploring-winnipeg-parks-dev-blog-intro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:39:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ryantherileyman.github.io/explorewpgparks-devblog/posts/2025/07/exploring-winnipeg-parks-dev-blog-intro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome! For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up a website featuring my photos of parks, community centres, and other landmarks throughout my home town of Winnipeg. I started this personal project about a year-and-a-half into the Covid lockdown period, in large part as a way to get myself outdoors and staying active. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve visited enough parks throughout the city to post well over 100 photo galleries, with many more in the queue!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
