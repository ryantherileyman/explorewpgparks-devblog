Developer blog, code snippets, and projects related to the development of the Exploring Winnipeg Parks website:

The developer blog on GitHub Pages is cross-posted from Hashnode:

This developer blog will focus on documenting my journey from a fully static, manually managed photography website, to an automated website using Python scripts.  I'll share code snippets in this repository, and possibly larger projects in the future that are relevant to related technical tasks such as image processing or interactive maps.
